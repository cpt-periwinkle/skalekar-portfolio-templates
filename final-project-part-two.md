# Wireframes / storyboards

This section walks through how the reader will experience the story from beginning to end.
My goal is to not only describe what each section will show, but explain why the transitions are structured the way they are and how each dataset connects logically to the next.

After refining my outline from Part I, I shifted to a much stronger central narrative:

__People think their shopping habits are random.
But the data shows we are surprisingly predictable —
until emotion, geography, or cultural events push us off our patterns.__

This theme shapes the entire storyboard.

Below is the full structure I’ll follow in Shorthand.
Each “frame” corresponds to a scroll section that introduces an insight, supports it with one of my visualizations, and leads naturally into the next dataset.

## Narrative Flow

### Frame 1 - Opening: “We think we shop randomly.”

Intro text explaining the premise: most of us assume our shopping choices are impulsive, reactive, or unstructured.

No visualization yet as I want to add in some build up just setting curiosity.

### Frame 2 - “But our habits are more predictable than we realize.”

<img width="975" height="586" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cb3c5cf-496f-47dc-aab6-3f9b37e8d009" />

Why it appears here:
This begins the micro-level analysis by revealing the first stable behavior — most shoppers repeatedly buy from the same dominant categories.

Transition:
If categories are predictable, what about how we choose to receive our purchases?

### Frame 3 - “Even shipping preferences barely change our spending.”

<img width="975" height="1020" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/480d9b9d-7c2a-49ac-865a-68ee302ac7df" />

Insight:
Regardless of choosing free shipping, express, or next-day, average spend stays nearly the same.

Transition:
So maybe subscriptions — like Amazon Prime — influence spending?

### Frame 4 - “Subscriptions also don’t meaningfully change spending.”

<img width="550" height="1253" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51db5b42-4f19-4f94-aa61-3f818c5c7686" />

Insight:
Another stable pattern. People spend almost the same amount whether they subscribe or not.

Transition:
If behavior doesn’t change much by shipping or subscription… does seasonality matter?

### Frame 5 - “Even seasons barely move the needle.”

<img width="739" height="1257" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c96a83b1-6c0c-497b-b731-49ad0da8b556" />

But seasons do change something else:

<img width="975" height="265" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cf860a6-07ab-4b55-83e1-46cb74629db2" />

Insight:
Spending per order stays the same — but how often people shop shifts noticeably with seasons.

Narrative turning point:
This is the first hint that frequency, not amount, is the real behavioral lever.

Transition:
If routine factors (shipping, subs, season) barely change our spend, what actually does?

### Frame 6 - “Emotion changes everything — enter the holidays.”

<img width="975" height="671" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15b5b8da-5544-4198-ad8d-78fc53472260" />

Insight:
Holiday gift spending reveals the first major disruption to stable behavior.
“Family gifts” dominate emotionally driven spending every year.

Why it matters in the story:
This is where predictability breaks — emotion overrides routine.

Transition:
But is this just one season, or does this follow long-term cultural change?

### Frame 7 - “Holiday spending on clothing has surged over two decades.”

<img width="975" height="513" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26b3c8dd-5eeb-478a-80d4-48fd2a8a44d5" />

Insight:
Clothing-related holiday spending has climbed steadily from 2004–2021.

Narrative purpose:
This reinforces that emotional/cultural moments create structural behavioral shifts over time.

Transition:
We’ve looked at individual habits and national patterns; now zoom out geographically.

### Frame 8 - “Across states, spending looks remarkably similar.”

<img width="975" height="554" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2841a2c0-b871-494b-8e1b-182b5ab1c2ac" />

Insight:
Despite differences in population, culture, and income, average online-shopping spend by state is surprisingly uniform.

Why here:
This confirms the main narrative theme:
- People shop more similarly than we think.
- Only seasons, emotions, and cultural rituals cause major changes.

### Frame 9 - Closing Reflection / Call to Action

I end by tying the narrative back to the reader:

“Your shopping habits may feel spontaneous, but the data suggests otherwise.
What changes isn’t the amount you spend — it’s why, when, and how often you shop.”

Encourage mindfulness around triggers:
- sales
- holidays
- convenience
- cultural pressure
- emotional buying

# User research 

## Target audience

__Target Audience__
I am designing this project for a general, non-technical audience—specifically:

- college students
- young professionals
- frequent online shoppers
- people who want to understand their own habits
- readers who enjoy data-driven storytelling

__Approach to selecting interviewees:__
I chose individuals who shop online at least occasionally and represent different perspectives:

- someone who shops frequently
- someone who shops occasionally
- someone who budgets intentionally
- someone who impulse buys
- someone unfamiliar with data visualization

This diversity helps me see how different people interpret the same visuals.

## Interview script

__Research Goals__

- Evaluate whether the story progression (individual → national → seasonal → geographic) makes sense.
- See if readers understand how different datasets connect.
- Identify which visuals are clear vs confusing.
- Test whether the call-to-action feels meaningful.
- Identify improvements for clarity, flow, or visual design.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Understand flow     |  Does the story make sense to you?                |
| Visual clarity     | Which chart felt easiest to understand? Which was hardest?            |
| Engagement     | Did any part feel too long, repetitive, or sudden?                 |
| Emotional/reflective impact     | Did the final section make you think about your own habits?                |
| Accessibility/style     | Are the color choices and layout comfortable to read?                 |

## Interview findings

My interviewees were the following-

- Interviewee 1 was a student from the MSISPM Program who does not shop online often
- Interviewee 2 was a SWE developer who frequently shops online
- Interviewee 3 was a student from the MSE Program who will shop online if there is deal present

| Questions               | Interviewee 1 | Interviee 2 | Interviewee 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Does the story make sense to you?  |     Yes       |             |     Yes        |
| Which chart felt easiest to understand? Which was hardest?  |  Easiest was Category Chart, hardest was Gift Chart     |             |  Seasonal bar chart easy, map was hardest           |
| Did any part feel too long, repetitive, or sudden?   |  US map appeared suddenly   |             | Nothing felt too off            |
| Did the final section make you think about your own habits?  | Understood implication, no tangible action  |             |  Yes  |
| Are the colors, spacing, and layout comfortable to read?  | Colors are well thought out, font needs to be bigger  |             |  Font was too small, color was great           |

# Moodboard: Modern Shopping Aesthetic
For this project, I wanted a visual identity that felt clean, modern, and consistent with contemporary e-commerce design. Because the story focuses on clothing and everyday online shopping behavior, I chose a palette and style that is calm, minimal, and easy to read.
The priority was ensuring ADA-compliant contrast, clear hierarchy, and a unified look across Tableau, Datawrapper, and Shorthand. I also decided to go for a minimalist style for my data viz.

## Core Color Palette
- Teal (#2A9D8F) — primary data color, modern, high contrast, ADA-safe
- Mustard (#E9C46A) — warm accent used sparingly
- Coral (#E76F51) — highlight color for emotional/seasonal emphasis
- Sand Orange (#F4A261) — annotation accent
- Deep Slate (#1A2A33) — high-contrast text and outlines
- Grays (#E0E0E0, #9E9E9E, #4A4A4A) — muted, non-important elements

__Design rule:__

Teal carries the main metric. Warm colors highlight key takeaways.
Grays de-emphasize everything else to keep visuals clean and readable.

# Personas

## 1. Maya, the Seasonal Online Shopper
Maya (23) is a fashion-conscious graduate student who shops online frequently and prefers clean, modern interfaces. She browses often but buys selectively, follows seasonal trends, and values fast shipping and a smooth visual experience. Maya dislikes cluttered charts, too many colors, or anything that feels overly technical. She wants quick insights that feel relevant to her habits — “Why do I shop more in fall?” or “Does my shipping choice actually matter?”
Designing for Maya helps keep the story simple, visual-first, and grounded in real behavior patterns.

## 2. Jason, the Practical Budget-Watcher
Jason (28) is a pragmatic young professional who shops online when he needs something, not for fun. He compares prices across sites, waits for deals, and avoids impulse buys. He prefers straightforward visuals, muted colors, and charts that get to the point quickly. Jason wants insights that help him understand whether his habits are “normal” compared to the average shopper — especially around spending, subscriptions, and shipping choices. Designing for Jason keeps the story grounded, logical, and efficient.

## 3. Priya, the Convenience-Driven Shopper
Priya (26) is a busy graduate student who values convenience above all else. She buys online to save time, often selecting whatever shipping gets items to her fastest. She doesn’t overanalyze purchases and rarely tracks how often she shops. Priya prefers bright, clean layouts, clear labels, and minimal reading. She wants insights that reveal how her habits fit into bigger patterns — “Do other people also shop more during certain seasons?” or “Am I overspending without realizing it?”
Designing for Priya encourages a story that is accessible, intuitive, and easy to skim.
