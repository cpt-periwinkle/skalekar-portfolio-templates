# Wireframes / storyboards

This section walks through exactly how the reader will experience the story from beginning to end.
My goal with the storyboard is to not just describe what each section will show, but also why it transitions the way it does, and how each dataset connects logically to the next.
Based on feedback from Part I, I’ve made the links between the behavioral dataset and the holiday/national datasets tighter and more deliberate.

Below is the full structure I will follow in Shorthand.
Each “frame” corresponds to a scroll section that introduces insight, supports it with a visualization, and leads cleanly into the next dataset.

# User research 

## Target audience

__Target Audience__
I am designing this project for a general, non-technical audience—specifically:

- college students
- young professionals
- frequent online shoppers
- people who want to understand their own habits
- readers who enjoy data-driven storytelling

__Approach to selecting interviewees:__
I chose individuals who shop online at least occasionally and represent different perspectives:

- someone who shops frequently
- someone who shops occasionally
- someone who budgets intentionally
- someone who impulse buys
- someone unfamiliar with data visualization

This diversity helps me see how different people interpret the same visuals.

## Interview script

__Research Goals__

- Evaluate whether the story progression (individual → national → seasonal → geographic) makes sense.
- See if readers understand how different datasets connect.
- Identify which visuals are clear vs confusing.
- Test whether the call-to-action feels meaningful.
- Identify improvements for clarity, flow, or visual design.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Understand flow     |  Does the order of sections make sense as you scroll?                |
| Understand dataset connections     | Did you clearly understand how the micro-level data connects to national trends?                 |
| Visual clarity     | Which visual felt the easiest to understand? Which was the hardest?                 |
| Engagement     | Did any part of the story feel too long or too sudden?                 |
| Emotional/reflective impact     | Did the final section make you think about your own shopping habits?                 |
| Accessibility/style     | Are the color choices and layout comfortable to read?                 |

## Interview findings

My interviewees were the following-

- Interviewee 1 was a student from the MAM Program who had worked lightly in design
- Interviewee 2 was a student from the MISM program who had worked with data previously
- Interviewee 3 was also a student from the MISM program who was working on becoming a Product Manager
