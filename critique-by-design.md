# Critique by Redesign

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

This assignment was an interesting one as I got utilize many of the skills I had learnt over the weeks in our **Telling Stories with Data Class**. In this assignment, we had to pick through the list of viz from the Makeover Monday website, where people post visualizations to critique by redesign. I found this as a great application of my understanding of visualizations!

## Step one: the visualization

I chose to redesign [**The Cheapest Way to Get Your Protein**](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w8) from the Makeover Monday catalog, which was the viz that was put up on February 2, 2023. The reason I chose this particular viz after going through many was because I felt this was a viz which would be useful for me to understand as a person who is picky about my diet. I felt the viz was very relatable, but there were some things which could have improved my understanding and could benefit from a redesign.

## Step two: the critique

In this step, I actually decided to use both the critique method provided in the Good Charts book as well as the one provided in [Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) as given through the Google Form. Through critiquing through both these processes, I gained further insight into how I felt about the project.

### Good Charts Method
I first listed down the things I thought of when I first looked at the viz, such as the title, the pictures and the calorie counts. It did give the idea of the viz being a measure of protein to cost.

I really liked the simple colors and the obvious title. It was easy on the eyes in that regard, depicting the data in a very simple way, which is always useful when it comes to getting information quick. The graph being a bar chart also made the simplicity apparent, as the idea should be clear with the data provided.

What I did not like as much was the mention of calorie counts, the pictures and the scale of the costs. The calorie counts especially throw you off, as it does not actually depict the value of the bar, despite annotating as if it is. The pictures also add nothing to the viz, as it is named below, adding a level of bloat to the otherwise simple graph. Finally, the scale itself I found very unintuitive, especially combined with the calorie counts. Even with the lines, it wasn't giving me any clean insights into how much it all costs, making it a bit disappointing.

I wish I saw some sort of marking or color change to mark which is the best protein or bang for your buck. I believe this graph in its current state is just data but it is not very intuitive to glean actual understanding of. The cost per 30g of Protein also confuses as you get the feeling that quorn is the best, even though it is the most expensive for 30g of protein.

Three things I felt which definitely needed to change were-
- Improve the scale or make it more detailed
- Remove the bloat such as the pictures which are not adding anything
- Use the calorie counts in a different way as it was too confusing in the original graph

### Stephen Few's Method
This method I used through the means of the Google form, which made it easy to understand what I was supposed to do.

**1. Usefulness-**

I feel the viz was useful in terms of the title as it told the story well, but the actual data itself needed a few moments to parse. With its scale being quite unintuitive to me personally, I felt that this viz was useful in terms of giving the idea but doesn't actually tell you the story as well outside of the title. However, if you put in some effort, it will be quite useful for those who care about their diet.

**2. Completeness-**

The data itself is pretty complete as it sets out to tell the story it wanted to tell, which is comparing the price of protein for different food sources. I believe it does give the idea and allows the user to actually gain complete insights. However, I personally think that maybe if we could somehow visualize how much is the smallest container of one of the protien sources would have made it more useful.

**3. Perceptibility-**

I believe this viz artist was onto something in terms of the bar chart being a simple yet effective way of showing the contents of the data, as it feels very easy to understand. However, there's too much extraneous elements like calorie counts and pictures which are very distracting, which is why I don't think it's the understandable viz.

**4. Truthfulness-**

The data itself is incredibly accurate, especially once compared to the dataset provided. There is the problem such as the calorie counts not even being present in the dataset, but otherwise, it is very truthful.

**5. Intuitiveness-**

As mentioned in perceptibility, there's a certain level of intuitiveness in this viz coming through the idea  of the bar chart and it being sorted. I can tell that the heights of the bar charts are important, though I misunderstood that height as at first glance I misunderstood the tallest being the least costly, even though that means its the most expensive. I think inversing the relationship would make it more intuitive.

**6. Aesthetics-**

I personally found the aesthetics of the viz just fine. It isn't rocking the boat, but it isn't the ugliest thing on Earth either. I would say that the simple bar chart is making it at least slightly pleasing on the eyes, but not by much.

**7. Engagement-**

This was not a very engaging viz for me, especially since it wasn't very useful in terms of actual shown data. The title itself is incredibly eye catching for those people who are on a diet, but other than that the information gets lost due to the number of distracting elements in the diagram itself.

**8. Describe your overall observations about the data visualization-**

The viz depicted is very striking to me through the title alone. As a person who is very careful about my diet, I found the title incredibly eye-capturing. The simple bar graph made it easy to see which foods have the highest cost as per the protein amount, though I would say on first glance I'd have thought it was a graph on cost per gram of protein. To me, the graph feels like it should be telling one story but it seems to be the exact opposite due to the way the sorting has been done. The pictures also seem a bit distracting and additional, since we already have the names, so it feels like we are just adding more components even though it's not required. I also feel the calorie accounts on the bar is distracting as it feels as if the data is mislabeled.

**9. Who is the target audience and is this an effective viz for reaching that audience?**

The primary audience seems to be people who are both fitness and budget conscious. The visualization seems to be effective in grabbing attention, but needs to be clearer about it's meaning since there seems to be a lot of extraneous components, as to get usable information needs some longer reading and parsing.

**10. What are you planning on redesigning?**

I plan on making the calorie counts useful as I feel as though it is misrepresented in this viz. I'll probably be trying a wide variety of categorized viz, trying to maintain the simplicity, as well as maybe using colors with a legend to better represent the data without overly distracting from the main idea for the target audience.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

![Sketch 1](sketch1.png)
![Sketch 2](sketch2.png)

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
