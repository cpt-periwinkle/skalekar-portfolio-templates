# The final data story

My final data story, Why I Keep Overspending Every Holiday Season, explores impulse spending, holiday-driven shopping behavior, and the emotional triggers that shape consumer habits. Rather than approaching the topic analytically as I had originally planned, I reframed the narrative around a personal perspective: I tell the story as if I were the impulsive holiday shopper persona. This choice allowed the data to feel relatable and helped ground national statistics in real, familiar experiences.

The story combines illustrations, fact blocks, and minimal, focused visualizations to reveal why holiday seasons consistently drive large surges in impulse spending. It highlights patterns such as rising online spending near year-end, the strong influence of discounts, and the emotional factors that change how people shop in November and December.

The narrative concludes with a practical call to action, offering three steps—creating a “freeze list,” setting a realistic impulse budget, and establishing a pre-holiday spending plan. These steps translate the insights from the data into meaningful behavioral strategies. By ending with a forward-looking, personal commitment, the story connects the emotional arc to actionable change and invites readers to reflect on their own habits.

# Changes made since Part II
The greatest change between Part II and Part III came from a crucial constraint: I learned that the synthetic Kaggle dataset I used earlier could not be used for the final project. Because my entire Part II narrative, storyboard, and Tableau prototypes were anchored to that dataset, I had to pivot the story significantly. Instead of forcing the original multi-dataset “U.S. shopping behavior” analysis, I reframed the project around real, citable national data on impulse buying and holiday spending.

I still wanted to keep the theme of shopping and the holiday season, so I brainstormed alternative angles and researched credible sources like Adobe’s Digital Economy Index, Statista, Capital One Shopping, the National Retail Federation, PR Newswire, and amra & elma’s consumer behavior reports. These datasets allowed me to build a grounded, evidence-based narrative about impulse spending—one that still aligned with the interests of my original audience but no longer relied on the synthetic dataset.

As I redesigned the story, I moved away from the analytical, exploratory tone of Part II. Instead of walking readers through shipping choices, subscriptions, categories, seasons, and geography, the new story became personal, emotional, and focused. I presented the narrative from the point of view of the impulsive holiday shopper persona. This helped create a cohesive and relatable experience that matched the content of the new datasets and improved audience engagement.

I also revised the visual structure of the Shorthand layout. The earlier draft included Tableau maps and multi-metric charts. In the final story, I simplified the visuals, used fact blocks to anchor key insights, and redesigned the flow so that illustrations, charts, and narrative sections reinforced each other. User research from Part II also influenced several refinements: I increased font sizes, strengthened transitions between sections, adjusted color contrast, and ensured citations and data sources were clearly presented.

Overall, the pivot resulted in a more focused, personal, and accessible data story—one that uses real, reliable data while maintaining the emotional arc and seasonal relevance at the heart of my original idea.

## The audience
My target audience remains online shoppers, especially young adults who tend to shop impulsively or during seasonal events. However, the pivot to real national datasets allowed me to refine the audience further: instead of speaking to a broad consumer population, I concentrated on impulsive holiday shoppers—people who overspend not because they need more things, but because holiday emotions, cultural expectations, and discounts reshape their habits.

To reinforce this audience connection, I presented the story as if I were the persona. Many people identify with the feeling of thinking they are “responsible shoppers” until November arrives. This narrative choice made the data more relatable because readers could see their own patterns mirrored in the statistics.

The personas developed in Part II directly shaped this approach. Maya, the seasonal online shopper, and Priya, the convenience-driven shopper, helped me design a story that was minimalist, readable, and visually clean. Jason’s persona—the practical budget-watcher—reminded me to tie insights back to real habits and end with concrete actions.

User interviews also influenced the final direction. Interviewees consistently wanted clearer transitions, larger fonts, more context on averages, and visuals that felt less abrupt. Although the underlying dataset changed, the feedback carried over: I prioritized clarity, emotional resonance, and accessibility in the redesign. The result is a story that feels personal yet broadly relevant—a reflection of why so many people overspend during the holiday season and how data can help them change that.

## Final design decisions
Several design decisions guided the final version of this project:

### Maintaining the original color palette

Even though the narrative changed, I kept my Part II color palette. I had already designed early visuals in these colors, and the palette aligned with my moodboard’s “modern shopping aesthetic.” It created continuity across all phases of the project.

### Using Tableau and Datawrapper together

I used a hybrid visualization workflow:

Tableau for my bubble charts
Tableau’s strength is fine-grained control—custom sizing, spacing, label behavior, and color tuning. For charts that needed precise visual adjustments, Tableau gave me the flexibility I wanted.

Datawrapper for my bar charts and line visualizations
Datawrapper allowed me to produce clean, publication-ready charts quickly. It helped maintain consistency with minimal setup time and ensured excellent on-screen readability inside Shorthand.

Using both tools gave me the best of both worlds: Tableau for detail-oriented refinement and Datawrapper for fast, polished clarity.

### Using illustrations from Storyset + Unsplash

Because the story became personal and emotional, I incorporated clean, copyright-free illustrations that aligned with the tone. Storyset added a warm, approachable style, while Unsplash provided subtle photography that reinforced the atmosphere without overwhelming the narrative.

### Center alignment for a personal storytelling feel

Unlike analytical dashboards, this Shorthand story is center-aligned. This makes the narrative feel intimate and conversational, drawing readers into the experience of the impulsive holiday shopper persona.

### Symmetry and structured layout

I intentionally alternated white and dark sections, paired facts with visuals, and began and ended with illustrations to create a symmetrical, predictable structure. This pacing creates visual rhythm and makes the story easier to follow.

### Visuals that support — not dominate — the story

Because the narrative voice is personal, I prioritized simpler, more focused visuals. Instead of complex Tableau dashboards, I used intentionally minimal charts so the emotional beats remained the center of attention. The visuals reinforce the narrative rather than competing with it.

### Accessibility improvements based on feedback

Interviews from Part II influenced several adjustments: larger font sizes, clearer legends, smoother transitions, and explicit data source notes. Even with the dataset pivot, these refinements still applied and improved readability and audience connection.

### Challenges with Shorthand as a platform

While Shorthand enabled a clean, scroll-based storytelling style, I found the platform somewhat restrictive. I wasn’t always able to apply the fine-grained design control I wanted, especially compared to tools like Tableau. Despite these limitations, I was able to work within the constraints to produce a cohesive and visually engaging final story.

# Final thoughts
This project ended up being very different from what I originally planned, but the changes ultimately made the story stronger. Pivoting away from a synthetic dataset pushed me to think more creatively about how to tell a meaningful story using real national data. While I originally expected to build a broad analytical exploration of U.S. shopping behavior, the personal narrative format allowed for a more engaging, emotionally grounded final product.

If I had more time, I would explore additional real datasets to compare year-over-year impulse spending trends in more detail or build an interactive budget planner as part of the call to action. Still, I am happy with the final story: it is clean, accessible, personal, and backed by credible data—exactly what I hoped to achieve when reimagining the project.
