# About me
Hi!  My name is Shlok Kalekar (he/him). I'm a Master of Information Systems Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm working to become 
a technical consultant, so I am hoping to get better understanding information and technology as a whole. You could say I have a love for all things 
technology, and am always keen to learn more!

# What I hope to learn

- How to effectively present data in the form of visualizations
- How to provide users with an easy way to interact with information
- Learn some design techniques and methodologies!

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

- ## Assignment 3: [Visualizing Government Debt](dataviz-examples)
- ## Assignment 4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
- ## Final Project
  Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.
